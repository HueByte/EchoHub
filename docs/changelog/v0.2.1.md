# v0.2.1 - Shutdown & CI Fixes

## Fixes

- Fixed server hanging on Ctrl+C when the directory server is unreachable — `StopAsync` now cancels background services before disposing connections
- Fixed IRC gateway shutdown blocking indefinitely on unresponsive clients — send operations are now bounded to 2 seconds
- Fixed CI release workflow not having full git history for building release notes (`fetch-depth: 0`)
- Fixed `workflow_dispatch` trigger breaking change detection when `github.event.before` is empty

## Improvements

- GitHub releases now include a commit list and version diff link instead of generic auto-generated notes
- GitHub releases link to the full changelog on the docs site
