# v0.2.2 - Shutdown Fix

## Fixes

- Actually fixed server hanging on Ctrl+C — replaced `await using` with explicit dispose bounded to 3 seconds, so a stuck `HubConnection` can no longer block shutdown
- Reduced host shutdown timeout from 30s (default) to 5s
- Caught `OperationCanceledException` in the directory service reconnect loop so cancellation exits immediately instead of propagating through dispose
