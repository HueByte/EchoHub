# v0.2.5 - Audio Playback, File Downloads & IRC Fixes

## Features

### Audio Message Support

- New `Audio` message type — uploaded audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.flac`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.wma`) are automatically detected and categorized
- TUI client renders audio messages with `♪ [Audio: filename] (Enter to play)` indicator
- Press Enter on an audio message to play it locally via `AudioPlaybackService` (NetCoreAudio)
- IRC gateway formats audio messages as `♪ [Audio: filename] url`
- Server detects audio files by extension via `FileValidationHelper.IsAudioFile()`

### File Downloads

- Press Enter on a file message in the TUI client to download it to the local machine
- `ApiClient.DownloadFileAsync()` streams file downloads from the server
- File and audio messages in the chat list now show colored indicators with interaction hints

### File Cleanup Service

- `FileCleanupService` (BackgroundService) periodically removes old uploaded files
- Configurable via `Storage:CleanupIntervalHours` (default 1h) and `Storage:RetentionDays` (default 30d)

### Data Migration Service

- `DataMigrationService` runs at startup to handle schema/data evolution
- Ensures `#general` channel and pre-existing channels are marked public
- Migrates legacy ANSI escape codes in image messages to printable color tags (`{F:RRGGBB}`, `{B:RRGGBB}`, `{X}`)
- Migrates legacy single-object `EmbedJson` to array format
- Promotes usernames listed in `Server:Admins` config to Admin role

### True Transparent Background

- Transparent theme now uses the terminal's native background instead of solid black
- Powered by `Color.Transparent` (alpha=0) which emits ANSI `CSI 49m` (default background) instead of explicit RGB
- Terminal transparency, acrylic, wallpaper effects now show through the TUI
- Dialogs retain solid `DarkGray` background for readability
- Uses local Terminal.Gui fork (submodule) with transparent color support pending upstream merge ([gui-cs/Terminal.Gui#4234](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui/pull/4234))

### Enhanced Status Bar

- Status bar now shows **EchoHub** branding at the start
- Connection state is color-coded: green (Connected), red (Disconnected), yellow (transitional states like Connecting, Reconnecting, Authenticating)
- Current channel shows its type: `#channel - public` or `#channel - private`

### Remember Me (Session Persistence)

- "Remember me" checkbox in the connect dialog — saves a 30-day refresh token so users can reconnect without entering their password
- Saved servers with active sessions show `[session]` indicator in the connect dialog and saved servers list
- Token-based login: selecting a saved server with a session lets you click Login with an empty password
- Graceful expiry handling: if the saved session is expired or revoked, shows an error and prompts for password
- Refresh token rotation: rotated tokens are automatically persisted to config so the session stays valid across refreshes
- New "Logout" menu item (Server menu): revokes the refresh token server-side and clears the saved session
- Removed dead `SavedServer.Token` field (stored 15-min access token that was never read back)

### #general Channel Protection

- `#general` channel is now auto-recreated if somehow missing (both in `GetChannels` endpoint and `JoinChannel` flow)
- Users cannot `/leave` the #general channel (client-side guard)
- Connecting while already connected now prompts to disconnect first instead of silently leaking the previous connection

## Fixes

### IRC Gateway

- **Fixed: IRC JOIN history replay showed encrypted gibberish** — `IrcCommandHandler.HandleJoinAsync` now decrypts channel history before formatting for IRC clients (history was encrypted for SignalR transport but sent raw to IRC)
- **Fixed: `JoinedChannels` race condition** — `IrcClientConnection.JoinedChannels` replaced with thread-safe methods (`JoinChannel`, `LeaveChannel`, `IsInChannel`, `GetJoinedChannels`) using lock synchronization; prevents crashes when broadcaster threads read while the command handler writes
- **Fixed: `RequireRegistered` fire-and-forget** — converted from sync `bool` to `async Task<bool>` (`RequireRegisteredAsync`) so the error reply is properly awaited before the handler returns

### ChannelService Extraction

- Extracted channel management logic from `ChannelsController` and `ChatService` into a dedicated `IChannelService` / `ChannelService`
- `ChannelsController` is now a thin adapter — delegates CRUD operations to `IChannelService` and maps `ChannelError` to HTTP status codes
- `ChatService.JoinChannelAsync` delegates channel validation + membership to `IChannelService.EnsureChannelMembershipAsync()`
- New `ChannelOperationResult` result type with `ChannelError` enum for typed error handling across service boundaries
- IRC gateway uses `IChannelService` for topic queries and channel listing (instead of `IChatService`)

### EchoHub Branding

- Status bar "EchoHub" text now uses golden color (218, 165, 32)

## Infrastructure

- Audio MIME types in `FilesController` (mp3, wav, ogg, flac, aac, m4a, wma)
- `FakeChannelService` test helper added for IRC unit tests
- Test suites: ChatLine, CommandHandler, DataMigrationService, FileValidationHelper, ImageToAsciiService, IrcMessageFormatter, JwtTokenService, LinkEmbedService
- IRC abstraction layer test suite: IrcMessage parsing, IrcMessageFormatter, IrcClientConnection, IrcCommandHandler, IrcBroadcaster
- Test helpers: `TestDuplexStream`, `TestIrcConnectionFactory`, `FakeChatService`, `FakeChannelService`, `FakeEncryptionService` for IRC unit testing without network I/O
- 346 total tests
