# v0.1.1 - Directory Connection Self-Healing

## Fixes

- Server now reconnects to the EchoHubSpace directory indefinitely when the API goes down, using exponential backoff (2s → 30s cap)
- If automatic reconnect is exhausted, the connection is rebuilt from scratch automatically
- Initial connection attempts also use exponential backoff instead of a fixed 30s delay
