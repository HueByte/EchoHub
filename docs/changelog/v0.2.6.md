# v0.2.6

## Refactoring

- Add hex color parsing helper and implement custom list sources for channels and users
- Add dialogs for connection, channel creation, profile editing, and status management

## Infrastructure

- Release workflow: use `--notes-file` instead of inline `--notes` interpolation to prevent shell expansion of special characters in commit messages
