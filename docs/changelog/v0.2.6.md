# v0.2.6

## Refactoring

- Extracted `ChatMessageManager` from `MainWindow` — message storage, formatting, and mutation logic now in a dedicated class, reducing MainWindow complexity
- Split `ChatRenderer.cs` (8 classes, 548 lines) into 7 individual files: `ChatSegment`, `ChatLine`, `ChatListSource`, `ChannelListSource`, `UserListSource`, `ChatColors`, `ColorHelper`, `RenderHelpers`
- Extracted `ConnectionManager` from `AppOrchestrator` — connection lifecycle, authentication, SignalR event wiring, and channel tracking now in a dedicated service
- Extracted `AvatarHelper` — deduplicated avatar upload logic previously duplicated in `/avatar` command and profile edit dialog
- Consolidated `ProfileEditDialog.ParseHexToTrueColor` into shared `ColorHelper.ParseHexToColor`
- Extracted `UserSession` — session state (`Username`, `Status`, `StatusMessage`) now in a dedicated class instead of scattered fields
- Replaced 21 inline command handler lambdas with named `HandleCmd*` methods for improved readability
- Extracted shared `CleanupConnectionAsync` to deduplicate disconnect/logout cleanup logic
- Reorganized flat `UI/` folder (19 files) into subfolders: `Chat/`, `Dialogs/`, `ListSources/`, `Helpers/` with matching namespaces
- Moved `AsyncRunner` from project root to `Services/` with updated namespace
- Renamed `ColorHelper` → `HexColorHelper` to avoid namespace collision with Terminal.Gui's `ColorHelper` NuGet dependency
- Moved `hue_icon.ico` to `Client/Assets/`, removed duplicate from Server (Server now references shared icon via relative path)
- Add hex color parsing helper and implement custom list sources for channels and users
- Add dialogs for connection, channel creation, profile editing, and status management

## Infrastructure

- Release workflow: use `--notes-file` instead of inline `--notes` interpolation to prevent shell expansion of special characters in commit messages
