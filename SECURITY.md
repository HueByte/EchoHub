## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in EchoHub (for example: auth bypass, token leakage, file upload validation bypass, RCE, etc.), please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Preferred: use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting ("Report a vulnerability"):

If that link is unavailable for your account, contact the maintainer via GitHub:

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept
- Affected versions / commit SHA
- Any relevant logs (with secrets removed)

## Disclosure

I’ll acknowledge receipt, investigate, and work on a fix. Please avoid publicly disclosing details until a fix is available.
